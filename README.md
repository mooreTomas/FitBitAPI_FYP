# Android Application - Uses FitBit API - FYP

Firebase Authentication and Firebase realtime database used. Users can register and utilise their FitBit accounts to access their data via the application, which does so by using the FItBit API ( using oAuth 2.0).

Application focuses on weight cutting for combat athletes, monitors daily weight and flags any users that are losing weight too quickly. Other users monitoring the athletes are notified of these flagged instances.

Simple GUI, focus on functionality.

Functionality of the API may be extended if time permits...
